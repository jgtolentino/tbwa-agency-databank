```

## Next Steps: Deploy Frontend

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Follow the prompts to:
# - Link to your Vercel account
# - Configure project settings
# - Deploy the application
```

### Option 2: Netlify Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
# Option A: Drag and drop the 'dist' folder to Netlify
# Option B: Use Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment
1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Upload the `dist` folder to your hosting provider
3. Ensure your hosting provider serves the `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)

## Verification Steps

After deploying the frontend:

1. **Test Authentication**
   - Login should work with real backend
   - No mock data fallbacks

2. **Test Document Upload**
   - Upload a document
   - Verify it's stored in the backend

3. **Test AI Analysis**
   - Run video/document analysis
   - Confirm results come from backend

4. **Monitor Network Tab**
   - All API calls should go to: `https://mcp-sqlite-server.onrender.com`
   - No localhost or mock endpoints

## Important Notes

1. **No Mock Data**: The application is configured to use ONLY real backend data
2. **Error Handling**: If backend is unavailable, proper error messages will be shown
3. **Environment**: Make sure `.env` is not committed to version control
4. **CORS**: Backend is configured to accept requests from any origin

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Backend Health**: 
   ```bash
   curl https://mcp-sqlite-server.onrender.com/health
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure `.env` is loaded correctly
   - Check browser console for the correct API URL

3. **CORS Issues**:
   - Backend is configured for CORS
   - If issues persist, check browser console for specific errors
