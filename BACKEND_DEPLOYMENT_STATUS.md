## 📋 Next Steps for You

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `mcp-sqlite-backend`
3. Make it private (optional)
4. **Don't** initialize with README

### Step 2: Push MCP Backend to GitHub
```bash
cd /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/mcp-sqlite-server
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-sqlite-backend.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Render
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up/Sign in
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect GitHub and select your repo
5. Render will auto-detect Docker setup
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

### Step 4: Get Your Backend URL
After deployment, you'll get:
- URL: `https://mcp-sqlite-backend-xxxxx.onrender.com`
- API Key: Found in Render Environment tab

### Step 5: Update Frontend
```bash
cd /Users/tbwa/Documents/GitHub/tbwa-lions-palette-forge

# Create .env file
echo "VITE_MCP_HTTP_URL=https://mcp-sqlite-backend-xxxxx.onrender.com" > .env
echo "VITE_USE_MOCK_API=false" >> .env
echo "VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-from-render" >> .env

# Test with live backend
npm run dev

# Verify connection
npm run verify-backend-live-strict
```

### Step 6: Deploy Frontend
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# OR deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] Frontend BackendStatusMonitor shows "Live API"
- [ ] Video analysis works with real data
- [ ] Campaign dashboard loads real data
- [ ] No mock data warnings in console

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Docker Desktop**: You don't need Docker running locally - Render builds in the cloud
2. **Database**: SQLite is included in the Docker image - fine for demo/light use
3. **API Key**: Keep it secure, don't commit to Git
4. **CORS**: Already configured for localhost and your domain

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Render logs for backend errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure frontend .env has correct backend URL
4. Run verification scripts to diagnose

**Status**: Ready for deployment! Just need to push to GitHub and deploy on Render.
